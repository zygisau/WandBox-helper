# WandBox-helper

![version][version-badge] 

This is simple Chrome browser extension that works in www.wandbox.com. It makes wandbox console more readable by changing its colors.

## Purpose

Our OP lecturer uses wandbox to show coding examples. Although, it's really hard to see the output due to lack of contrast between background and text.

## How to use it?

- Open Wandbox
- Run Your code
- Press Ctrl + Shift + Y (Mac: Command + Shift + Y)
- Enjoy simple and light color scheme of the console

Or

- Instead of shortcuts, press extension's icon.

## BIG THANKS TO [Mindaugas Kasiulis](https://github.com/gitguuddd) WHO ENSURED THIS EXTENSION TO WORK AS SMOOTH AS SILK :heart:
